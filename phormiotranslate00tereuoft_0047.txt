THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

these things happen to everybody, they can happen to
you, so there should n't be anything surprising in them;
but everything that surprises you by ending well, you can
set down as so much clear gain.

GE. (asz'de.) Ha, Phaedria! It's past belief how much
more of a sage Ι am than my master. Ι have reflected on
all the troubles that master’s return will bring upon me,—
grinding to do at the mill, floggings to get, fetters to wear,
set to work on the farm. Not a single one of them will
take me by surprise. But everything that surprises me by
ending well, I shall set down as so much clear gain. But
why don't you step up to him and address him politely to
begin with?

DE. There ’5 my nephew Phaedria, I see, coming to meet
me. PH. How do you do, uncle? DE. How do you do?
but where 's Antipho? PH. You ’ve got back safe, —

DE. Yes, yes ; but answer my question,

PH. He 's well—he ’5 here; but has everything gone to
your liking? DE. I wish it had, indeed.

PH. Why, what ’5 the matter?

DE. What a question, Phaedria! This is a fine marriage
that you ’ve cooked up here while I was away!

PH. Holloa! are you angry with him for that?

GE. (aside.) Fine acting!

DE. And should n't Ι be angry with him? Why, I'm
just aching to get a sight of him, so that he may find out
once for all how he 's turned his good-natured old father
into a perfect savage! PH. But he has n't done anything
to make you angry, uncle. DE. Now just look at that!
birds of 3 feather! they ’re all in it! When you know one,
you know all. PH. It is n’t so,

DE. When A ‘s in trouble, B turns up to make excuses
for him; and when it ’5 B, then up comes A. They go
partners in it. GE. (assde.) The old man 's drawn a fine
sketch of their proceedings without knowing it.
