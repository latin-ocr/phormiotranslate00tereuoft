THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

AN. Yes, and I have had an inkling of this story, too.

' GE. Yes, and I'll give you something to make you be-
lieve still more. After a while your uncle came out here,
and soon aster that he went in again with your father.
They both said that you were allowed to keep her. Finally
Ι was sent to look you up and bring you home.

AN. Why don't you drag me off then? What are you
waiting for?
GE. I’ll do it mighty quick.
AN. Good-bye, my dearPhormio.
PH. Good-‘bye, Antipho. God bless me, this is a good
thing. I'm glad of it.
(Exennt AN. and GE. to DE'S.)

SCENE VII

PH. What an unexpected piece of good luel< for these
boys! And nowI have a fine chance to take the old gen-
tlemen in, and to rid Phaedria of his worry about the money.
so that he shan’t have to beg it of any of his fellows. For
this very same money, given already, shall be his outright
in spite of all their opposition. The facts have shown me
, how to force them to it. I must now put on a new air and
change my expression. I'll withdraw into this alley close
by and show myself to them from there when they come out.
Ι shan’t go to the fair as I pretended. (I‘Vz'tlzdraws, R.)

SCENE, VIII

(Enter DE. and CII. from DE'S.)

DE. I am grateful and thankful to the gods, brother, and
they deserve it, since 311 this has turned out so well for us
to-day. ·
