THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

ACT IV
SCENEI

(Enter DEMIPHo and CHREMEs‚ L.)

DE. Well, Chremes, did you bring your daughter with
you, what you went to Lemnos for? CH. No.

DE. Why not? CH. Why, when her mother saw that Ι
kept staying and staying on in Athens, and the girl was
grown up and could n’t be neglected any longer, she set
out, they told me, bag and baggage, to come and find me.

DE. Then why, I want to know, did you stay there so
long when you heard that? CH. ’Gad, I was kept there by
illness. DE. How so? what illness?

CH. What illness? old age is illness enough in itself‚
But the skipper who brought them told me that they
reached here safe and sound. DE. Have you heard what
has happened to my son in my absence, Chremes?

'Cn That’s just what makes me so undecided in my
plans. For if Ι offer her fn marriage to any outsider, I
must tell the whole story of how and by whom Ι carne to
be her father. As for you, Ι knew that you were as loyal
to me as Ι arn to myself. But if a stranger seeks alliance
with me, he will hold his tongue just so long as we are
close friends with one another; but if he breaks with me,
then he will know more than he ought to know. And I 'm
afraid my wife may get an inkling οἱ all this. If she does,
the only thing lest for me to do is to give myself a shake
and leave the house; for Ι ’m all I ’ve got in the world.

DE. Ι know that is so; that 's what makes me so anxious,
and I shall never weary of making every effort to perform
my promise for you. ²
