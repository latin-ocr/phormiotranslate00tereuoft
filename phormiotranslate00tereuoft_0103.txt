THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. What 's the matter ?

CH. To think of your trusting me so little!

DE. You want me to believe it, then? you want me to
consider it settled ? Very well, have it so. But then, what's

CH. Oh, that 's all right.

DE. Shall we drop her, then?

CH. Why not?

DE. And this one is to stay?

CH. Yes. DE. You can go, then, Nausistrata.

NA. Good gracious, I think it is better for all concerned
that she should stay, than to have it as you first intended;

for she seemed to me a very lady-like thing when Ι saw her.
(Exit NA. to CH’S.)

DE. Now, what is the meaning of this business?

CH. Has she shut the door yet? DE. Yes.

CH. O Lord! heaven does smile on us! Ι ’ve found
my daughter married to your son!

DE. Bless me! how can that be ?

CH. This place is n’t safe enough to tell the story in.

DE. Well, come indoors, then.

CH. Look here, I don’t want our sons to get an inkling of
this. (Exeunt ΐο DE'S.)

by simple means when things go wrong! No sooner has be
got the money than he ’s freed from anxiety3 but here I am,
unable to get out of these troubles by any means whatever,
