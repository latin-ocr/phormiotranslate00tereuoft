THE PROLOGUE
ΒΥ J. B. GREENOUGH

That this to 311 1)6 prospered is our prayer;
Patrons of noble asts and judges fair,

&Ne are to act 3 play, 3 Latin one,

By Tully witnessed and by Roscius done,

The work of Terence3 with such names as these
To recommend us, we must surely please.

I called it Latin, I was partly wrong;

No doubt the verses to that tongue belong;
But incidents and thought are purely Greek,
The Latin part is but the words we speak.

For just as that we call an English play

Is what some Frenchman elever in that way
Has made before; so Romans thought no shame
To take from Greece and publish in their name.
What use, then, now to offer you 3 play

Not even native and long past its day,

A scenio outline when in Greek 't was made,
And now 3 faded shadow of that shade ?
Because while ages keep their steady pace,

The airns and nature of the human race
Continue still the same3 their sear and woe,
Their joys and their desires, no changes show.
The Latin that we speak in Grecian dress
Mirrors the nature of our age no less.

Only the outwarcl acts and garb are old,

The rest is fresh as when 't was first unrolled. —
