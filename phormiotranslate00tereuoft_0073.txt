THE PHoRM1o OF TERENCE. 49

DO. Ι have been putting up sor some months against
my will with your promising and not performing and your
whimpering; but now Ι 've got the opposite of all this. Ι
have found a man who pays and does n't cry about it.
Make way for your betters.

AN. But, by heaven, if I remember rightly, there was a
day set on which you were to pay him?

PH. There was.

DO. Ι don’t deny it, do I ?

AN. Has it come yet?

DO. No, but ‘co-day has come in ahead of it.

AN. Are n't you ashamed to be such a fraud?

DO. Not a bit if it is for my gain.

GE. Oh, you dunghill!

PH. Look here, Dorio, is this the right way to behave?

DO. It ’s my way; if you like me, take me as you find
me. ’

ΑΝ. And you cheat him like this?

DO. On the contrary, Antipho, it 's he who is cheating
me: for he knew all along that I was the sort of man Ι am;
but Ι supposed that he was different. He ’s taken me in,
but to him I am exactly what I was before. But never
mind; this is what I'll do. A soldier man has promised
to pay me the money to-morrow morning; now, Phaedria,
if you bring it to me before he does, I’ll follow my regular
rule, that he is the better man who is first to come down

with the cash. Good-bye. (Exit, R.)
