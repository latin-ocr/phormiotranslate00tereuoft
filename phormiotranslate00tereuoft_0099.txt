THE PHORQHO OF TERENCE

Geta? you ’ve put off the evil day for nOW‚ but there ’s a
crop of whippings growing if you don’t look out ahead. I'll
go home and tell Phanium that she must n’t be afraid of
Phormio or os Nausistrata’s talk. (Exit to DEMIPHO'S.)

SCENE H

(Emer DEMIPHO and NAUSISTRATA from CHREMEs's.)

DE. Come, then, Nausistrata, with your usual good
nature make her feel kindly towards us, so that she may
do of her own accord what must be done. NA. Iwill.

DE. You ’ll be aiding me now with your good offices,just
as you helped me a while ago with your purse.

NA. You 're quite welcome; and upon my word, it 's my
husband’s fault that Ι can do less than I might well do.

DE. Why, how is that ?

NA. Because he takes wretched care of my father‘s hon-
est savings; he used regularly to get two silver talents
from those estates. How much better one man is than
another! DE Two talents, do you say?

NA. Yes, two talents, and when prices were much lower
than now, DE. Whew ! NA. What do you think of that ?

DE. Oh, of course —

NA. Iwish Ι 'd been born a man. Ι ’d soon show you -—

DE. Oh yes, I’m sure. NA. The way —

DE. Pray, do save yourself up for her, lest she may wear
you out; she ’s young, you know.

NA. I’ll do as you tell me. But there 's my husband
coming out of your house.
