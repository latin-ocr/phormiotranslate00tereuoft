THE PHORQHO OF TERENCE

SCENE Π

(Enter GETA, R.)

GE. (asz‘de.) A shrewder fellow than Phormio I never
saw in my born days. I went to tell him that money was
wanted and how it was to be got. I had hardly told him
half the story when he understood it all,—began to laugh,
congratulated me, asked where the old man was. Then he
thanked heaven that now he had a chance to show that he
was as much of a friend to Phaedria as to Antipho. I told
the fellow to wait on 'Change, and said that I would bring
the old man there. Holloa! here he is. NVho’s that on
the other side? Oh my! Phaedria's father 's come home.
Lubber that I am, what was I afraid of? was it because I 've
got two to trick instead of one? It's handier, Ι think, to
have two strings to your bow. I'll try to get the money
from the man Ι meant originally. Jf he gives it, all right;

if nothing can be· done with him, then I'll attack this
newcomer.

SCENE HI

(Enter ANTIPHO‚ unobserved, R.)

AN. (asz'de.) Ι 'm expecting Geta back every minute.
Why, there ’s my uncle standing with my father. Dear me!
how I do sear what father may be driven to by his coming!

GE. I'll go up. Why! our good friend Chremes! how
do you do? CH. How do you do, Geta?

GE. I ’m delighted to see you back safe. CH. Dare say.

GE. How goes it? Do you find many surprises here, as
usual when a man comes home? CH. A good many.

GE. To be sure, Have you heard what 's happened to
Antipho? CH. The whole story.
