THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

,85

ΡΗ. Away with your promises and out with your ›

news!

GE. What! you here too, Phormio?

PH. Yes, but why don’t you go ahead?

GE. well, then, listen. After we had paid you the money
on 'Change‚ we started straight home3 then master sent me
over to see your wife.

AN. What for? .

GE. Ι 'll leave that out3 it 's nothing to do with the case,
Antipho. Just as Ι was entering my lady’s chamber, Mida,
her slave boy, ran up to me, caught me by the cloak behind
and pulled me back. Ι looked round and asked him what
he was stopping me for. He said that there was no admis-
sion to his mistress. ‘ Sophrona has just brought in the old
man’s brother Chremes and he ’s in there now with the
ladies,’ says he. When I heard that, Ι went up softly on
tiptoe, stood still, held my breath and put my ear against
the door; and Ι began to listen, trying to catch their talk
so fashion.

PH. Bravo, Geta!

GE. Vv'hereupon Ι heard a most beautiful piece of busi-
ness; so much so that, by craeky, Ι nearly shouted for joy.

AN. What was it?

GE. well, what do you think?

AN. I don’t know.

GE. But it’s most marvellous! Your uncle has proved
to be your wife Phanium's father.

AN. What’s that you say?

GE. He· lived with her mother at Lemnos unbeknownst.

PH. You 're dreamingl as if the girl would n't know her
own father!

GE. Oh well, depend upon it, Phormio. there ’s some
reason for that; but do you think that Ι, outside of the
door, could understand everything that went on between
them inside?
