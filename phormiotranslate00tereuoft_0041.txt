THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 17
Talk? 't would set him afire. Silence? merely egging
him on. Clear myself? might as well wash a brick.
Oh, dear me! I'm frightened on my own account, and
then I'm in torture when Ι think of Antipho. He 's the
man I'm sorry for. I ’m afraid for his sake now, and it ‘s
he that keeps me here. Why, if it were not for him, Ι
should have seen to myself easily enough, and got even
with the old man for his anger. I should just have got
some traps together, and then taken to my heels straight
out of here.

AN. (asida.) Why, what's this he ’s plotting about run-
ning away or stealing?

GE. But where shall I find Antipho? which way shall I
go to look for him?

PH. (aszde. ) He' s talking about you.

AN. (aszde.) I dread some great missortune from this
news. PH. (asecle.) Oh, dear!

GE. I’ll go on home. That's where he is generally.

PH. (asida.) Let’s call the fellow back.

AN. Stop where you are!

GE. Ha! pretty peremptory‚ don't care who you are!

AN. Geta! GE. It ’s the very man Ι wanted to find.

AN. Out with your news, for mercy's sake; and, if you
can, despatch it in one word.

GE. Iwill. AN. Speak out.

GE. Just now, down at the port— AN. My-

GE. You 've hit it. AN. I'm a dead man!

PII. Whew! AN. What shall I do? PH. What ’s this
you say?

GE. That I saw his father, your uncle.

AN. Now how am Ι to find a way out of this sudden
catastrophe, dear, dear me? Why, life is n’t worth living,
if it 's my sate to be torn away from you, Phanium.

GE. well, if that ’s so, Antipho, there ’s all the more
need of being wide awake. Fortune favors the brave.
