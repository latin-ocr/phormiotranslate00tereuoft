THE VArchN manuscript of TERENCE‚ numbered 3868 and
written in the tenth century, is remarkable for the miniatures
with which it is illustrated. These miniatum, based to a cer-
tain extent upon earlier works, are found at the beginning of
each scene, while at the beginning of each play the masks of
the different characters are represented.

The miniatures have never before been accurately reproduced.
The complete set for the Phormio is here given from photo-
graphs taken in the Vatican Library expressly for the Classical
Department of Harvard University. For the privilege of photo-
graphing and publishing, the Department is deeply indebted to
H1s Hommzss THE PoPE and to the CARDINAL LIBRARIAN
of the Vatican, and also returns its grateful thanks to the
Right Reverend J. J. ΚΕΑΝΕ, Rector of the Catholic University
of America, and to the Reverend Doctor F. Z. ROOKER‚ Vice-
Rector of the North American College in Rome, through whose
kind mediation the consent of the Vatican was obtained.

The number printed under each picture is that of the verse
before which the picture stands in the manuscript.
