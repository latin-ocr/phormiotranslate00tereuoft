THE PHORRHO OF TERENCE.

SCENE V

(Euter PHAEDRIA and DORIO, from DORIO‘S house.)

PH. Do listen to me, Dorio, for pity’s sake !

DO. No, Ι won’t. PH. Just a minute.

DO. Why won’t you let me alone?

PH. But listen to what I have to say.

DO. No; I ’m tired of hearing the same thing a thousand
times. PH. But now I'm going to say something which
you will like to hear. DO. Speak out then. I ’m listening.
.. PH. Can't Ι prevail on you to wait just these three days?

Why, where are you going now? DO. Ι wondered whether
you had anything new to bring forward.

AN. (asz'de.) Oh, dear! I ’m afraid this slave-trader may
be — GE. (asz'de.) Hoist with his own petar? I'm afraid
so, too. PH. You don't believe me yet, eh?

Do, You 're a mind-reader! PH. But if I give you my
word? DO. Stuff! PH. You ’11 have reason to call your
kindness a fine investment. DO. Words, words.

PH. Believe me, you 'll be glad you did it. It’s true, by
heaven ! DO. Moonshine! ,

PH. Just try the experiment; it ’s not for long.

DO. Always singing the same old song!

PH. I ’ll call you my kinsman, — father, — friend —

Do. Nonsense! PH. To think of your being so hard
and unbending that' neither pity nor prayers can soften you l

DO. And to think 'of your being so unreasonable and
impudent, Phaedria, as to lead me on with gilded promises,
and so get my slave girl for nothing !

AN. (aside.) What a pity!

PH. Oh, dear me! he 's got the better of me.

GE. (asz'de.) How they both do live up to their own
characters.
