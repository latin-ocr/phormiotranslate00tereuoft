THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. Yes sir. CRA. Ι should like to have you act for the
interests of your house. Now this is the way it seems to
me; it ’s all right and proper that what your son has done
in your absence should be put back entirely as it was, and
you will carry that point. That ’s' what I say.

DE. Now, Hegio, it ’s your turn to speak.

HE. Ι believe that he has spoken advisedly; but this is
the way of it; many men of many minds, many birds of
many kinds; each man has his own point of view. Now it
does n't seem to me that what the law has done can be
undone; and it ’s discreditable to try it. DE. Well, Crito?
CRI. Ι vote we take time to think it over; it's important.

HE. We can’t do anything more for you, can we?

DE. You have done finely. (Exeunt advz‘sers, R.) I’m
much more bewildered than before. (Emer GE.srom DE.'S
house.) GE. They say he has n’t come in. DE. Ι must wait
for my brother. I’ll follow the advice which he gives me
in the matter. I'll go down to the port to find out when
'he 's to come home. (Exit L.) GE. And I'll go look
for Antipho, so that he may know how things are. But,
holloa! I see him coming in the nick of time.

SCENE IV

(Enter ANTIPHO, γ R.)

AN. Well, Antipho, you and your panic have much to
answer sor. The idea of your having made off and left your
very life in other people’s keeping ! Did you suppose that
others would attend to your business better than you would
yourself? No, no ; however it was about the rest, you cer-
tainly ought to have taken care of that girl of yours at horne,
to prevent her from getting into trouble from her trust in
you. All she has and all she hopes for, poor thing, hinge
on you alone nOW.
