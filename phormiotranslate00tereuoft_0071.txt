THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 47

PH. Think of all this trouble happening to me at the very
time when Antipho is full of another worry of his own!
AN. (coming sarward.) Why, Phaedria, what is all

ῒΙἸιΙΞἾΡΙ. Oh, Antipho, you luckiest of men!

AN. I?
PH. Yes; for the girl you love is in your own keeping,

and you 've nevervhad occasion to struggle with such a
difficulty as mine.

AN. In my own keeping? not quite so; Ι 'm ‘ holding a
wolf by the ears,’ as the old saying is.

PH. He? been behaving like a barbariam he 's sold my

Pamphila.
ΑΝ. What! sold her? ⁸
GE. You don't say so! sold her?

PH. Yes, he 's sold her.
DO. What an outrage, to sell a girl bought with my own

money!

PH. And Ι can‘t prevail on him to wait sor me and to put
off keeping his promise to the man for only three days,
while Ι am getting the money promised me by my friends.
If I don’tv pay it by that time, you need n't wait for me an
hour longer.

DO. Still dinning it into me?
AN. It's no long time he asks for. Come, consent.

He 'll return the kindness with a hundred per cent interest.

town, and can you bear to see such a pair of lovers
torn asunder?

DO. Of course Ι can't any more than you.

GE. Heaven send you what you deserve 1
