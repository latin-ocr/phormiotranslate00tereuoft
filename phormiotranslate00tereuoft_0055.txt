THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

GE. How does it corne about?

PH. It's because we never set traps for the hawks and
kites that really hurt us ; it ’5 only for birds that don't hurt
that traps are set. There ’5 something to be made out of
them, but on others it 's only time thrown away. Other
people have their dangers, from one source or another,—
people something can be got out of; but everybody knows
that I've got nothing to lose. But perhaps you ’ll say
that they ’ll convict me and take me horne to hold me
there. Oh, no3 they don't want to keep a ravenous fellow
like me3 they don’t want to do good for evil, and that 's
where they 're wise, I think.

GE. Well, he can't ever thank you as much as you
deserve.

PH. Not quite so. Nobody ever can thank his patron as
much as he deserves. Think of it! You come scot free to his
dinner, all persumed and shining from the bath, with a heart
free from care, when he ’5 drowned with worry and eaten up
with expenses. While everything’s done to your liking,
he 's snarling. You can laugh, drink your wine before
him, take the higher seat3 and then a puzzling banquet ’5
spread.

GE. What’s that?

PH. That ’5 when you ’re puzzled what to help yourself
to first. Now, when you come to reckon up how nice all
this is and how much it costs, are n’t you obliged to think
your host a god incarnate right before your eyes?

GE. Here ’5 the old man ; mind what you ’re about3 the
first onset is always the fiercest. If you stand that, you
may afterwards make play as you like.
