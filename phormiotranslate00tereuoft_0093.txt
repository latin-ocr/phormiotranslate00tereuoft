THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 69

CH. (asida.) Why, who 's this old woman that ’s come

out of my brother’s house so excited?
ΞΟ. It was our poverty that drove me to it,'though I ’ ’

knew such a marriage was a shaky thing, to provide that
at least she might be sure of a living in the mean time.

CH. (asz'de.) Upon my word, unless my mind 's going
or my eyesight ’s bad, that ’s my own daughter's nurse that
1 see there.

ΞΟ. And we can’t track out -—

CH. (asz'de.) What shall Ι do?

ΞΟ. 'Her father-—
CH. (aside.) Shall Ι go 'and speak to her, or stay where

Ι am until I know better what she is saying?
ΞΟ. If only Ι could find him, there 's nothing Ι should be

afraid of.
CH. It ’s the very woman. Ι ’ll speak to her.
SO. Who’s this talking here? CH. Sophrona!

CH. No! ΞΟ. What? no?
CH. Come over here a little, away from that door,

Sophrona, please, and don’t call me by that name any
more. ΞΟ. Why not? for mercy’s sake, are n't you the
man you always said you were? CH. Hush!

SO. What is there in this door that you ’re afraid os? l<

CH. Ι 've got a savage wife caged up in there. As for
that name, it was a wrong one which I took in those days, so
that you should n't let the truth leak out without meaning
to, and my wife find it out some way or other.

ΞΟ. Law me, that 's just why we poor women have never
been able to find you. CH. But tell me, what have you to
do with the people whose house you just came out from?
