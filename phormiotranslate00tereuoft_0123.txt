THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

NA. Patiently——why should I? I certainly do want to
have an end of it all, I'm so wretched; but how could Ι
expect that? can Ι count on his sinning less as he grows
older? He was an old man even then, if it ’s old age that
makes men virtuous. Do my own looks or my years make
me more attractive now than Ι was then, Demipho? Come,
what can you offer to make me expect or trust that this
won't happen again?

PH. All who desire to attend the funeral of Chremes,
now’s the time! That ’s the way I 'll give it to 'emi Now
come on, whoever wants to stir up Phormio! I'll ruin him
as completely as I have Chremes.

DE. Don't be so angry; calm yourself‚ Nausistrata.

PH. Yes, yes, let him back into your good graces; he ’s
been punished enough to satisfy me. And she 's got some-
thing to din into his ears just as long as he lives.

NA. Ι deserved it, then, I suppose. Why should I, at
this late day, Demipho, rehearse what a wife Ι ’ν6 been to
him?

DE. Ι know it all as well as you do.

NA. Do you think Ι 've deserved this treatment?

DE. Never in the world. But what ’s done cannot be
undone by reproaches. Do forgive him. He begs pardon,
— he owns up, — he offers to atone. what more can you
want?

PH. (asz‘de.) Really noun before she pardons him I must
look out for myself and Phaedria. (alond.) See here,
Nausistrata, just listen to me before you answer him off-
hand.

NA. What is it?

PH. I got thirty ducats out of him by 3 trick, and gave
them to your son. He bought his mistress with them from
her owner.
