SCENE 1 Ι’ ·’

(Enter ANTIPHO and PHAEDRIA from. the house
os CHREMES.)

AN. Oh, Phaedria, to think that it has come to this,
that Ι should be afraid of my own father whenever I
think of his coming home! He wishes nothing but my
good. If Ι had n’t been so thoughtless, Ι should be waiting
for his coming with joy.

PH. Why, what's the matter?

AN. Matter‚ you accomplice in my bold scheme? Oh,

how Ι wish it had never occurred to Phormio to urge me
to it, and that he had n’t driven me, when Ι was in the
heat of my passion, to take this step, which was the begin-
ning of all my troubles} Ι should n't have got the girl, of
course, and that would have made me wretched for some
days; but still, I should n’t be suffering this everlasting

anxiety all the time,—

PH. Yes, yes.
AN. Constantly expecting that he will soon be here to

break up this marriage of mine.
PH. Other men are wretched because they have n’t

got the object of their love, but you 're unhappy be-
cause you ’ve got too much of it. You 're embarrassed

with bliss, Antipho. But Ι tell you that your position
is one to be coveted and desired. Bless me, for the chance

to be so long with her Ι love I'm ready to pay down my
life. Only just reckon up all that I’m suffering from

privation and all that you ’re enjoying in possession!
