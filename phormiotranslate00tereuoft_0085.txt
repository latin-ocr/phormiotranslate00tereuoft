THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

CH. No, n0; 116 could n't have better brought about just
what we want. AN. (aside.) I 'm 3 dead man!

DE. Go on and finish. GE. At first the fellow was wild.

CH. Tell us what he asked. GE. Oh, a great deal too
much. CH. How much? speak.

GE. Ifyou 'd offer a great talent —- DE. A great big D,
you mean! What! has the fellow no shame?

GE. Just what I said to him. ‘ Look here,’ said I ; ‘ sup-
pose he were marrying off an only daughter of his own ; 116
1135 n't gained much by not having one himself if somebody
else's turns up for him ·to portion.’ Well, to be brief, and
omitting all his silly talk, this was finally his last word:

‘ From the very first,' says he, ‘ I have wanted to marry my-

old friend’s daughter myself, as was proper ; 101 I saw how
disagreeable it would be for her, a poor girl, married only
to be a rich man's slave. But, to tell you the honest truth,
I needed a wife who should bring me a little something to
pay off whatI owe; yes, and even after all that ’s passed,
if Demipho is willing to give as much as I am getting with
the girl to whom I am engaged, there ‘s nobody in the
world whom I should like better 101 3 wife.'

ΑΝ. (asz'de.) I can’t make out whether he 's acting from
stupidity or mischief, from design or off his guard.

DE. But suppose he owes body and soul?

GE. ‘ My farm‚' said he, ‘ is mortgaged for ten ducatsss

DE. Weil, well3 let him marry her. I'll pay it.

GE. ‘ Then my house for another ten.'

DE. VVhew! it ’s too much!

CH. Don’t make 3 row. You can get those ten 01 mc.

GE. ‘Then there ’s 3 lady's maid to bo bought for my
wife ; then I need a little more farnitum, and some cash to
spend on the wedding. Put down ten more for this,' says 116.

DE. Then let him bring hundreds and hundreds of law-
suits against me. I won't give him a penny. What! that
dirty fellow to get the laugh on me again?
