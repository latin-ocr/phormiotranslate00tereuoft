THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 11

GE. Antipho agreed—’t was done—off we went—got
beaten—he married her.

DA. What are you telling me?

GE. Just what you hear. ⁹

DA. Oh, Geta, what will become of you?

GE. By the powers I don't know that; but one thing Ι
do know, which is, that “bravely we’ll bear the burden
· fortune brings.”

DA. Ι like that; that ’s taking it like a little man.

GE. Ι ’ve no hope in anybody but myself.

DA. Good again!

GE. I suppose I must go to somebody who will beg me
off in this style: ‘Do let him off just this once; but if he
is ever guilty again, I won't say a word,’ —- all but adding,
‘ Kill him, for all me, when ¹I ’ve once got away.'

DA. What about the harp-lady’s chaperon? How ’s he
getting on? ’

GE. So, so. Pretty poorly.

DA. Has n't much to give, perhaps?

GE. Nothing at all but unadulterated hope.

DA. His father home yet or not? GE. Not yet.

DA. Well‚ how long before you expect your own old
man?

GE. I don't know sor sure, but I'm told that a letter
has come from him which has been taken to the custom-
house; I'll go after it.

DA. Can’t do anything more for you, Geta, can I?

GE. Only take care of yourself. (Exit DA„ R.) Hi!
boy ! is nobody ever coming? (Emer a slave.) Take this,
and give it to Dorcium. (Cives lzz'm tlte bag, and exit L.)
