THE PHORQHO OF TERENCE. 39

if he does n’t I ’11 shut him and his wife out of my house.
GE. (asz‘de.) He ’s in a passion.

PH. You ’d better do the same thing with yourself.

DE. So you ’re ready to take a stand against me in every-
thing, are you, you ill-starred wretch? PH. (asz’de to GE.)
He ’s afraid of us,though he tries hard to conceal it.

GE. (asz'de to PH.) Your first moves are well made.

PH. (alond.) Why not put up with what you must put
up with? that will be in keeping with your reputation, and
we shall be friends. DE. What! I seek your friendship,
or wish to see or hear of you? PH. If you make it up
with her, you 'll have somebody to cheer your old age;
think of your time of life.

DE. Keep her to cheer yourself. PH. Do moderate your
angry passions. DE. See here! enough said. If you don't
hurry and take that woman away, I ’ll throw her out of doors.
That ’s my last word, Phormio. PH. And if you lay a finger
on her in any way unbefitting a lad-y, I ’11 bring a smashing
suit against you. That 's my last word, Demipho. (Aside
to GE.) Here! if you need me for anything‚ you ’11 find me
at home. GE. All right! (Exit PHORMIQ R.)

SCENE HI

DE. What worry and trouble my son does give me by
involving himself and me in this marriage! And he does n't
come to let me see him either, so that at least Ι might know
what he has to say about the matter, or what he thinks.
Off with you ! see whether he has got home yet. GE. Yes.
(Exit to house of DEMIPHO.)

DE. (to lzz‘s advisers.) You see in what a state things are.
Now what am I to do? Tell me, Hegio.

HE. I? I move Cratinus does, if you please.

DE. Well, speak, Cratinus. CRA. Do you mean me?
