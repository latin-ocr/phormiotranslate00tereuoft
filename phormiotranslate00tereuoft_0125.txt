THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 101

CH. Hey! what ’s that you say?

NA. Do you think it 's so very bad for a young fellow
like your son to have one mistress, when here you are your-
self with two wives? Have you no sense of shame ? How
can you have the face to scold him for it? answer me that.

DE. He shall do everything you wish.

NA. Well, to let you know my decision, I neither pardon
him nor promise anything nor make any answer at all, before
seeing my son. Ι leave the whole thing to his judgment.
I 'll do whatever he tells me.

PH. You are a wise woman, Nausistrata.

NA. Does that satisfy you ? DE. Certainly.

CH. (asz'de.) Upon my word, Ι get out of it pretty finely,
and better than Ι expected.

NA. (lo PH.) Please to tell me your name.

PH. Phormio, a friend of your house, by heaven, and
particularly of your son Phaedria. NA. Well, Phormio,
after this Ι ’11 do and say sor you whatever you like as well
as I can, upon my word I will. PH. That's very kind of
you. NA. I 'm sure you have deserved it.

PH. Do you want to begin by giving me a pleasure
to-day, Nausistrata, and to make your husband’s eyes ache
at the same time ? NA. Yes.

PH. Then invite me to dinner.

NA. Certainly, I invite you.

DE. Let us go in, then.

NA. Well, but where is Phaedria, who is to decide be-
tween us?

PH. Ι 'll bring him here.

C. Farewell, and give us your applause.
