THE PHORMJO OF TERENCE.

CH. That ’s just what you ought to do; but make haste,
while he ’s still in the mood for it. If that other girl is
more messing, perhaps he 'll leave us in the lurch.

GE. (asz'de.) You 've hit the very point.

DE. (to GE.) Take me to him, then.

GE. Ι ’m ready.

CH. When you have attended to that, go over to my
wife’s to get her to call on the girl before she goes away.
Let her tell the girl, to prevent her from 'being angry, that
we are marrying her to Phormio, and that he is a better
match for her, because sshe knows him better; and that we
have done our duty, too, and given her as large a dowry as
he asked for.

DE. What the plague does that matter to you?

CH. A good deal, Demipho. It 's not enough for you to
do your duty if the world does n’t approve of what you ’ve
done. I want this to take place of her own free will, so that
she shan't be saying that we drove her out.

DE. Wess, Ι can bring all that about myself.

CH. But a woman 's the best hand to deal with a
woman.

DE. Ι ’11 ask her, then. (Exemzt DE. and GE.‚ R.)

CH. Ι wonder now where I can find those women?

SCENE VI

(Enter SOPHRONA from tlte house of DEMIPHO.)

ΞΟ. What shall Ι do? VVhere am I to find 3 friend
in my distress? whom shall I consult? where get help?
I'm afraid my mistress may come to grief from follow-

ing my advice; the young man's father takes all this so
hard, I hear.
