THE PHORMIO oF TERENCE.

DE. If it was n't so, you would n’t be taking his part,
Phaedria.

PH. Well, uncle, if it is a fact that Antipho has done a
wrong, regardless of his interests or reputation, Ι have
nothing to say against his suffering as he has deserved.
But if somebody took advantage of his own cunning to
lay a snare sor our youthful innocence and has caught us
in it, is it our fault or that of the judges? You know what
a habit they have of robbingthe rich from envy, and giving
to the poor from pity.

GE. (asida.) If Ι did n’t know the case, I should believe

that he was telling the truth. DE. Is there a judge alive.

who can possibly know your rights when you don't answer
a word yourself, like that son of mine ?

PH. He behaved like a young man of good breeding.
When we got into court, he could n't speak his piece3 his
modesty struck him quite dumb then and there.

GE. (asz'de.) Bravo, you! but shall Ι not address the
old man at once? (going sarward.) Good day, master.
I'm glad you ’ve got home safe.

DE. Ha, ha! fine guardian, good day. main stay of my
house; it was in your charge that I left my son when Ι
went away.

GE. I’ve heard you blaming us all for ever so long when
we did n't deserve it, and Ι least of anybody. Why, what
would you have had me do in the matter? the laws don't
allow a man who ’s a slave to plead-‚ and he can't give
evidence either.

DE. Ι waive all that, and Ι admit this, t00, that the boy
was afraid and unsuspecting. Ι grant that you are a slave.
But no matter how near a relative she was, he need n’t have
married her3 n0, no. You should have given her a dowry,
as the law directs‚ and let her look out sor another hus-
band. On what account, then, did he prefer to bring home
a pauper?
