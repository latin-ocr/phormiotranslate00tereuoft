THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

In that you saw another play of late
Unwitting Oedipus's crimes and fate,

Those were the deeds of heroes, tragic themes
For which sublimity well fitted seems,

The practisecl art of actorS, fine array

And Setting, with the fame of rare display.
Our aim is lower. Mortal men are we,

And so content the mimickers to be

Of human joys and griefs3 the gods may care
For their own matters, men are our affair.
Yet pray these lowly things do not disown,
They touch us nearer being better known,
The woes of Hecuba we 've long outgrown. —
Epidicazomenos was the Grecian name,

In Latin, though, it Phormio became;
Because the ‘stan' a parasite, is one

Named Phormio, by whom the most is done.
Do you, adopting Terence’ famous line,

‘I am a mam all that is man's is mine,'
Regard our novel effort with good will,

That generous arts may thrive among us still.
