THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

CH. (aside.) How or where did he ever come to find this
out? DE. (aside.) Ι don't know; but I'm sur-e I did n’t
tell anybody.

CH. (asida.) A perfect miracle, as Ι hope to live!

PH. (asida.) I 've put a spoke in his wheel.

DE. See here, is this rascal going to rob us of all this

, money and laugh in our very faces? By heaven, Ι 'll die the

death first! (asz'de to CH.) Make ready to be bold and have
your wits about you. You see your little peccadillo has got
out and you can't hide it from your wife any longer. The
easiest way to get it forgiven, Chremes, is for us to tell her
ourselves what she is sure to hear from others. And then
we shall be able to revenge ourselves at our ease upon this
dirty fellow. PH. (asz'de.) My goodness! I’m in a fix ifI
don't look out for myself. They are making at me with the
air of prize-fighters. CH. (asidc.) But I’m afraid we can’t
make her forgive me.

DE. (asida.) Courage, Chremes! I 'll bring you back
into her good graces, on the strength of this, that the
woman by whom you had this child is out of the way.

PH. That's the way you deal with me, is it? a cunning
attack enough! It ’s not for his good that you ’ve stirred me
up, Demipho, by heaven ! Aha! when you ’ve been carrying
on abroad after your own sweet will without any regard for
yonder noble lady, but on the contrary, insulting her in this
strange sashion‚ would you come now with prayers to wash
away your sin? Why, I'll set her so afire against you with
this story that you shan’t put her out though you actually
dissolve away in tears.

DE. W'as ever a man so impudent! Why does n’t the
government transport the knave to some desert island?

CH. I 'm reduced to such a state that Ι don't know what
to do with him. DE. Ι do, then. Let’s go to law.

PH. To law? to laer, if you don‘t mind. CH. Follow him
up; hold on to him while I call the slaves out.
