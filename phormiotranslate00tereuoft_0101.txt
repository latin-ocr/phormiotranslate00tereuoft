THE PHORQHO OF TERENCE.

SCENE HI

(Enter CHREMES.)

CH. Ha! Demipho, has the money been paid him yet?

DE. I saw to it at once. CH. I wish it had n’t been.

(aside.) Oh, dear! there ’s my wife. I had almost said too

much. DE. What makes you wish it had n't, Chremes?
CH. No matter now. DE. What have you been about?
have you told her why we are bringing Nausistrata ?

CH. I 've attended to it. DE. Well, what does she say ?

CH. She ’s not to be taken away. DE. Why is n’t she?

CH. Because they 're heart to heart.

DE. What ‘s that to us ?

CH. A good deal. Resides I have found out that she
really is related to us. DE. What? you 're raving.

CH. You ’ll find it 's so. I’m not speaking at random.
I 've recollected. DE. Are you in your right mind ?

NA. Oh, for mercy‘s sake! take care not to hurt a relative.

DE. She is n’t one. CH. Don’t say that. Her father went
by another name; that 's how you made a mistake.

DE. Did n't she know who her father was ? CH. Oh, yes.

DE. What made her call him something else ?

CH. Won't you ever stop insisting‚ and take in what Ι
mean ?

DE. But if you don't tell me anything ?

CH. (asz‘de to DE.) You 'll ruin me Ῐ ΝΑ. I wonder what
it all is. DE. By heaven, I’m sure I don't know.

CH. Do you want to know the truth ? Then, so help me
God, there is n't a man in the world nearer of kin to her
than you and I. DE. Great heavens! let ’s go straight to
her. Is it 's so, Ι want us all to know it alike—-or if it
is n't so. CH. Oh, dear!
