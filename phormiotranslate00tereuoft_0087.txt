THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 63

CH. Pray be quiet. Ι 'll pay it myself. All you ’ve got
to do is to make your son marry the girl we wish.

AN. (asz'dc.) Oh, dear me! you 've been the death of
1116, Geta, with your tricks. CH. She is turned out for my

Le'mnos. I ’ll take it out of that, and tell my wife that you
needed it. (Ea-eunt DE. and CH. to CHREMES'S.)

to succeed in a thing, leave it to this fellow, who can bring
you out of smooth sailing straight on to a rock! Why,
what could have been worse than to lay your finger on this
sore and to mention my wife? Here 's my father made to
hope that he can cast her off. Come now, what follows?
Suppose Phormio gets the dowry and has to marry her,
