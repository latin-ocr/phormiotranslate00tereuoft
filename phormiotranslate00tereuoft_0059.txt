THE PHORMIO· OF TERENCE.

GE. Will you persist in slandering my master behind his
back, you dirty dog?

PH. Serves him right. GE. Still more of it, you jail-
bird? DE. Geta— GE. You extortiones, you law-shark!

DE. Geta! PH. (asz'de.) Answer him.

GE. Whom have we here? oh! DE. Hold your tongue!

GE. Why, he 's been insulting you all day long behind
your back, -- insults that don't fit you and do fit him.

DE. Avast there! hold on! Youngman (to PH), to
begin with, I want to ask you this, with your kind permis-
sion, if you will be good enough to answer me: Explain to
me who this friend of yours was you 're talking about, and
how he said that Ι was related to him.

PH. There you are, fishing; as if you did n’t know.

DE. Did n't know? PH. Yes. DE. Ι say Ι don't; but
you, who say I do, just jog my memory.

PH. What, man ἔ not‘know your own eousin?

DE. You 're killing me. Tell me his name.

PH. His name; of course. DE. Why don’t you speak?

PH. (asida.) By the powers, I'm a gonerl I've sor-
gotten the name. DE. What ’s that you say?

PH. (asz'de lo GE.) Geta, just prompt me if you recol-
lect the name that was given at the time. (Alond.) No, I
won't tell you. You 're here to pump me, as if you did n’t
know it yourself. DE. What! Pumping you?

GE. (asida lo PH.) Stilpo. PH. And then again, what do
I care? It ’s Stilpo. DE. VVhom did you say?

PH. Stilpo, I tell you; you knew him. DE. Ῑ did n't
know him either, and I never had a relative of such a name.

PH. So, so? Don’t you feel abashed before these gen-
tlemen ? Yet if he had left a property worth ten talents —

DE. Oh confound you !

PH. You 'd be the very first with a tip-top memory to
trace your ancestry all the way from grandfather and great-
grandfather.
