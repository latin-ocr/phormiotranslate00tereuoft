Geta?

SCENE V

(Emer PHoRMIo, R.)

PH. I’ve received the money and handed it over to the
trader. I’ve taken away the girl and arranged that Phae-
dria may have her for 1115 own; she ’5 been emancipatecl.
Now there's only one thing left over for me to 566 to, and
that is to get time from the old gentlemen to make a §pree
of it. I propose to take some days off.

AN. Why, there 's Phormio. Say!

PH. Say what?

ΑΝ. What ’s Phaedria going to do now? how does 116
ρτορο56 to spend his honeymoon?

PH. He’s going to take his turn at playing your part.
ΑΝ. What part 15 that?

PH. To run away from his father. And he requests you
in return to play 1115 and plead his cause for him. The
fact is, 116 15 going to my house for a little spree. I shall
tell the old gentlemen that I am going down to Sunium to
the sair, to buy that lady’s maid that Geta talked about;
then they won't think I'm squandering their money when
they don’t 566 1116 here. But there ’5 a noise at your front

doon
AN. See who 15 coming out. PII. It ’5 Geta.
