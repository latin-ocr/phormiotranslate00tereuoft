THE PHORQHO OF TERENCE. 33

SCENE H.

(Enter DEMIPHO and lais advisers, R.)

DE. Did you ever hear of a more insulting piece of
injustice done to anybody than this to me? Stand by me.
I beg of you. GE. (assde.) He ’s in a passion.

PH. (to GE. asz'de.) Mind your cue now; I'm going to
touch him up pretty quick. (Aloud, to GE.) Great heavens!
does Demipho actually dercy that Phanium ’s related to him?
What! Demipho, says this girl 's no relation?

GE. He says not. PH. And that he does n’t know who
her father was? GE. He says not.

DE. Ι fancy this is the very man I was talking about.
Follow me.

PH. Because the poor thing is left in poverty. her father
is disowned and she herself is abandoned. Only see what
avarice does! GE. You 'll hear what you won't like if you
insinuate anything wrong about my master.

DE. Oh, what impudencel Why, he 's come to take the
initiative by accusing me !

PH. I've no reason at all to be angry with the young
fellow for not knowing her father; of course he was a man
pretty well along, poor, working for his living, generally
keeping in the country, where my father let him have a
farm to cultivate. The old fellow used often to tell me how
this kinsman of his neglected him. But what a fine man
he was! the best l ever saw in all my life.

GE. I hope you 'll ever see yourself such as you de-
scribe him.

PH. You be hanged! No; ifI had n’t esteemed him as
I did, I should never have got into a quarrcl with your
people, all on account of this girl that your master’s slight-
ing now in this ungentlemanlike way.
