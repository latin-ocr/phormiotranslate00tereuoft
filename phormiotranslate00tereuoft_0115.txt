THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. What ’s to be done then?

PH. If you will give me the lady as you promised, I will
marry her3 but if you really want her to stay with you,
Demipho, why the dowry must stay with me. It is n't fair
that Ι should be the loser through the means of you two;
for it was out of regard for you that I broke off with the
other lady who was to bring me just as large a dowry.

DE. You be hanged with your high-toned talk, you vaga-
bond! do you suppose that we don’t know you and your
doings? PH. You 're making me angry. DE. So you ’d
marry her, would you, if we gave her to you?

PH. Try it on. DE. Yes, so that my son might live with
her in your house; that was your scheme.

PH. What are you talking about, pray? DE. Come, hand
over my money. PH. Not much, you hand over my wife.

DE. Walk straight into court then. PH. Look here, if
you are going to keep on being troublesome —

DE. What are you going to do about it? PH. I? perhaps
you two think that I ’m the protector of undowried women
only; but Ι 'm in the habit of protecting dowried ones too.

CH. What 's that tov us? PH. Oh, nothing. But Iknew a
woman round here whose husband married —

‘CH Ha! DE. What ’s the matter? PH. Another wife
at Lemnos -- CH. I'm done for! PH. By whom he had
a daughter; is bringing her up, too, on the sly. CH. Ι 'm as
good as buried. PH. I ’m just going to tell her all about it.

CH. For heaven's sake, don't! PH. Oh, you were the
man, were you? DE. What game he ’s making osus !

CH. We let you off scot free. PH. Oh. bosh! CH. well,
what would you have? We let you off with the money that
you 've got. PH. Oh, yes! Why the deuce are you making

91

game os me with your silly, childish shilly-shallying? ‘I “

won’t, Iwill, and Ι will, Ι won't,'——one after the other;
‘ take it— give it back’ -say a thing and unsay it; make
a bargain one minute and break it off the next. .
