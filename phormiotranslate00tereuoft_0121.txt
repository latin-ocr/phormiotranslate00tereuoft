THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

NA. But what?

CH. There 's no need of telling.

PH. Not for you of course, but she ought to know. In
Lemnos——

NA. Ah! what 's that you say?

CH. Won’t you hold your tongue?

PH. Behind your back —

CH. Oh dear me!

PH. He married another wife.

NA. God forbid, my dear man!

PH. It 's true.

NA. Alas! I'm undone!

PH. And by her he ’s already had one daughter too,
without your dreaming of it.

CH. What shall I do?

NA. Oh heavens! what a wicked, shameful thing!

PH. Do? you 're done for!

NA. Was there ever anything more infamous! When it
comes to their wives, they ’re old enough, forsooth! Demi-
pho, I appeal to you, for I am sick of talking to this creature.
This was the meaning, was it, of all those constant trips and
long stays at Lemnos? this was the low prices that reduced
our rents there?

DE. For my part, Nausistrata, I don’t say that he does n't
deserve to be blamed in this matter, but it is a fault that
may be pardoned.

PH. Might as well talk to the dead.

DE. The fact is, it was not that he did n’t care for you or
that he disliked you. His affair with this woman was
about fifteen years ago, once when he had drunk too much,
and that was how this girl came to be born; he never went
near the woman afterwards; she is (lead and out of the way:
that was the only stumbling-block left. And so I beg of
you that you will bear this patiently‚ as you act in other
things.
