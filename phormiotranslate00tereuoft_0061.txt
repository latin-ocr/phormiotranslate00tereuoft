THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 37

DE. Very likely, as you say. well, when Ι came for·
ward Ι should have stated how she was related to me. Now,
you do the same. Come, how is she related? GE. Bravo,
master, well done ἔ and you, sir, look out for yourself.

PH. My duty was to explain it to the court, and I did
so with perfect clearness. If it was n't true, why did n't
your son disprove it on the spot? DE. You talk to me
about my son? Why,1 can' find words to describe his
stupidity. PH. well, then, ygu who are so wise, go to the
magistrates and make them try the same case all over again
sor you. For you tall< as though you were sole lord para-
mount in these parts and the only man alive entitled to a
second trial of the same case.

DE. Though I have been unjustly treated, still, rather
than go to law or have to listen to you —here‚ just as if
she really were related, take these five ducatS, the dowry
that the law directs, and carry her away.

PH. Ha! ha! ha! you sweety! DE. What’s the matter?
there ’s nothing wrong in my demand, is there? am I not
to get the benefit of what is the law os the land?

PH. Does the law direct you, I’d like to know, to pay
her and send her off like a courtesan? Or was it to prevent
a sreeborn lady from doing anything to disgrace herself
through poverty that the law directs to give her to her
nearest kinsman to live with him? and that 's just what
you 're preventing.

DE. YeS, to her nearest kinsman. But how do we come
in, or on what grounds? PH. Oh, dear ! ‘ don’t open a case
that 's closed‚' as the saying goes. DE. Don’t open it? on
the contrary, I ’ll never rest until Ι 've seen it through.

PH. Silly of you. DE. You just let me alone.

PH. In short, Demipho, I ’ve nothing to do with you. It
was your son that lost the suit, not you; for your time for
marrying was gone long ago.

DE. You can take him as saying all that Ι say now;
