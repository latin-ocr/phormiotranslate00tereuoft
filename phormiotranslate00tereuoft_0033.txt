THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

fact, if she had n't been the very essence of beauty, all this
would have eclipsed her beauty. The young fellow who
was in love with the harp—lady only said, ‘She ’s very
pretty; ' but my young master-—

DA. I know without being told3 he fell in love with her.

GE. Rather! See how it turns out. The very next
day he went straight to the old woman; begged that he
might have her. But she refused, and said he was n’t doing
the proper thing; ‘for the girl was an Athenian, a good
girl of good stock. If he wanted to marry her, it could be
done in the regular legal way3 but if he meant anything
else, no.’ My master did n't know what to do; on the one
hand he longed to marry the girl, on the other he was afraid
of his father, who was gone abroad.

DA. would n't his father have given him leave when he
came home? GE. What, he! give leave to marry a girl
without a dowry and of unknown family? Never in the
world.

DA. Well, what happened in the end?

GE. What happened? There 's a parasite of the name
of Phormio—a cheeky fellow — blast him!

DA. Why, what's he been up to?

GE. He supplied the scheme which I am going to de-
scribe. ‘There ’s a law,' says he, ‘that orphan girls must
marry their next of kin, and by the same law the kinsmen
are obliged to marry them. Now, I'll say that you ’re her
kinsman, and I'll bring a suit against you. I'll pretend
that I was a friend of the girl's father. We shall come into
court. Who her father was, and who her mother, and how
she is related to you, I’ll make all that up. It will be
good and easy for me, for you won't disprove any of the
charges, and so of course Ι shall win. Your father will
come home; that means a lawsuit against me. But what
do I care for that? The girl will be ours anyhow.

DA. A jolly piece of cheek!
